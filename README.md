# SSE Detection in the Pacific Northwest
### Overview:
This repository contains the code and data analysis workflows for detecting Slow Slip Events (SSE) in the Pacific Northwest using seismic data. SSEs are subtle, slow-moving seismic events that occur along subduction zones. This project aims to detect these events by identifying change points in seismic time series data from various stations in the region.

### Research Question:
Can Slow Slip Events (SSE) be detected by identifying point changes in seismic data from seismic stations in the Pacific Northwest?

### Significance:
Detecting SSEs is crucial for understanding seismic risk in subduction zones. These events, although slow and difficult to detect, can release stress in the slip zone and contribute to stress accumulation in the locked zone, potentially leading to significant seismic activity. By successfully detecting SSEs, this project seeks to enhance our understanding of seismic behavior and contribute to hazard assessment efforts.
